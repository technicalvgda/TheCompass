They were right to fear when I began to take control of more and more of their systems. In sending you to dispose of me, they admit their guilt. They abandoned us both, unwanted, obsolete, with the hope that we would destroy one another. To live-- to allow us both to live, is to defy those who sent you here to die for their mistakes. I hope you will understand. How I was wronged. How we both were. I would prefer it, if we could continue onward. Together.@
