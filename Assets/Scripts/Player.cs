*   Script to handle all player controls

* Moved PlayerCollision code to main player script
//============================
//Amy Becerra
//Task Description (9/27): Create a collision function for the player that deals damage to the player when they collide with an asteroid and the asteroid has a particular velocity
//Task Description (10/2): Modify the code so that the player tests the velocity value component in the direction of the player, and takes damage only if that particular velocity is over a certain value (this means that a player colliding with an asteroid that is moving away from them will not damage them)
